               <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
               <p>Front-end development, often referred to as client-side development, involves building the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It focuses on what users interact with directly in their web browsers. Here's a basic introduction to front-end development:
                <h4>Languages and Technologies:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages.</li>
                    <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style the HTML elements and control their appearance, layout, and presentation.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows you to manipulate the HTML and CSS, handle events, and interact with the user.</li>
                    <li>Frameworks and Libraries: Front-end developers often use frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to streamline development and enhance functionality.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
